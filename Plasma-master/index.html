<q class="ques">What is Plasma Therapy?</q><br><br>



 <a class="ans">
    Plasma therapy is a medical procedure that uses the blood of a recovered patient to create antibodies on those infected individuals.<br>
     Medically known as convalescent plasma therapy, this treatment uses antibodies found in the blood taken from a recovered Covid-19 patient.<br>
    It is then used to treat those with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection to aid recovery.
    </a><br><br>
    
    <q class="ques">How Does Plasma Therapy Work?</q><br><br>
    
    
    
    <a class="ans">
        Blood is taken from a previously infected but completely recovered patient, the plasma component of that blood 
        is separated and that contains the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus. This plasma is injected into an infected personâ€™s body that will fight the virus and neutralise it from spreading.
        and blood sample will be checked for any existing harmful diseases such as Hepatitis B & C including HIV.</a><br><br>
    
    
    <q class="ques">Does Plasma Therapy Cure COVID?</q><br><br>
    
    
    
    <a class="ans">
    Currently, it has shown positive results in Delhi and Mumbai where COVID cases are spiking high.
     It has also proven to improve the ability of a person to recover from the disease. 
    However, there is more research required to prove its full efficacy in different patient types.
    </a><br><br>

    <q class="ques">Why it's done</q><br><br>

    <a class="ans">Convalescent plasma therapy may be given to people who are hospitalized with COVID-19.<br><br><br>
    
    Convalescent plasma therapy may help people recover from COVID-19. It may lessen the severity or shorten the length of the disease.</a><br><br>


    <q class="ques">Before the procedure</q><br><br>

    <a class="ans">Before convalescent plasma therapy, your health care team prepares you for the procedure. 
A health care team member inserts a sterile single-use needle connected to a tube (intravenous, or IV, line) into a vein in one of your arms.</a><br><br>

<q class="ques">During the procedure</q><br><br>

<a class="ans">When the plasma arrives, the sterile plasma bag is attached to the tube and the plasma drips out of the bag and into the tube. 
It takes about one to two hours to complete the procedure.</a><br><br>

<q class="ques">After the procedure</q><br><br>

<a class="ans">You'll be closely monitored after you receive the convalescent plasma. Your doctor will record your response to the treatment.
He or she also may record how long you need to stay in the hospital and if you need other therapies.</a><br><br>
